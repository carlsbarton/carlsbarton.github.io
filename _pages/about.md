I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems at Birkbeck.

My key research interests are in algorithms for the analysis of
strings and sequences, with a focus on algorithmic problems arising in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Next generation sequencing data are large collections of
strings and developments in the area of string algorithms have turned
genomic analysis from a highly computationally demanding task, into a
routine activity possible on a laptop. My research interests span both
the theoretical and practical aspects of such algorithmic problems. I am
most passionate about performing research where the algorithms can be
effectively applied to real world applications; this can be seen by my
experience working on interdisciplinary projects solving a range of real
problems.
