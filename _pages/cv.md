Education
======
* 2011 - 2014: PhD Computer Science, Department of Informatics, King's
College London, UK.\
*Title of thesis: 'Algorithmic Problems in Strings with Applications to
Sequence Analysis'*.\
Supervisors: Professor Costas S. Iliopoulos and Professor Maxime
Crochemore.

* 2007 - 2011: MSci Computer Science (First class hons), Department of
Informatics, King's College London, UK.\
*Title of thesis: 'The Provenance of Source Code Execution Results'*.\
Supervisor: Dr Simon Miles.

Work experience
======
* 2020 - 2020: Postdoctoral Research Fellow, *'Automatic segmentation
and measurement of medaka fish phenotypes'.* European Bioinformatics
Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK. I am responsible
for the development of an automatic segmentation tool to measure a wide
variety of phenotypes of medaka fish. The aim is to automatically
segment CT images of different inbred medaka fish lines in order to
determine measurements of their internal organs and skeletal structure.
This data will then be used to perform a large genome wide association
study to understand how the different genetic variants present in
different groups of inbred individuals lead to specific phenotypes.

* 2016 - 2020: Postdoctoral Research Fellow, *'Reconstructing the dynamic
3D architecture of the human genome by super resolution microscopy and
DNA sequence modelling'*. European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome
Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK. I was responsible for developing
computational methods/tools to investigate the 3D structure of genomes
via super resolution microscopy techniques. I developed the first
computational simulation of this problem and also proposed the first
algorithmic solution to the problem.

* 2014 - 2016: Postdoctoral Research Assistant, *'Ageing-associated DNA
methylation dynamics in mammals'.* Blizard Institute, Barts and The
London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of
London, UK. This project investigated the dynamics between age and DNA
methylation across different mammals. I designed and performed the
appropriate data analysis of DNA samples. This presented numerous
challenges as many of the samples had over 90% bacterial contamination.
This project produced the first dynamic molecular readout of lifespan
differences among mammalian species.

* 2010 - 2010: Research Assistant, *'Navigating data provenance across
distributed source code execution'*. Department of Informatics, King's
College London, UK. Undergraduate research internship supervised by Dr
Simon Miles, funded by EPSRC Vacation Bursaries Scheme. I developed a
system to automatically annotate source code to allow for the recording
and querying of data provenance.

  
Skills
======
My key research interests are in algorithms for the analysis of
strings and sequences, with a focus on algorithmic problems arising in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Next generation sequencing data are large collections of
strings and developments in the area of string algorithms have turned
genomic analysis from a highly computationally demanding task, into a
routine activity possible on a laptop. My research interests span both
the theoretical and practical aspects of such algorithmic problems. I am
most passionate about performing research where the algorithms can be
effectively applied to real world applications; this can be seen by my
experience working on interdisciplinary projects solving a range of real
problems.
