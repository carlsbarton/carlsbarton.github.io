* This letter describes a new heuristic algorithm to compute the cyclic edit distance.

* We extend an existing algorithm which compares circular sequences using q-grams.

* Theoretical insight to support the suitability of the algorithm is provided.

* Experiments show the heuristic is more accurate compared to existing heuristics.

* Experiments show the heuristic is faster compared to existing heuristics.
